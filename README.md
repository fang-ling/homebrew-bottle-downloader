## Homebrew bottle downloader

A command-line tool that enables you to download Homebrew binary packages (including their dependencies, and the dependencies of their dependencies...). You don't even have to install Homebrew.

## How to use?

For instance, if you wish to download `zstd` for macOS Sonoma, simply input the command `zxq zstd sonoma`.

```shell
$ zxq zstd sonoma
curl -L -H "Authorization: Bearer QQ==" -o xz.tar.gz https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/xz/blobs/sha256:bdd5146737d8a84b8a855d7b1bdc81cd2d20692c5d77810fa7472cd9bb41fb47
curl -L -H "Authorization: Bearer QQ==" -o zstd.tar.gz https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/zstd/blobs/sha256:2137fe12a266078c16b162342500c7efa263def709e6742bfb4bf8601a3f36af
curl -L -H "Authorization: Bearer QQ==" -o lz4.tar.gz https://ghcr.io/v2/homebrew/core/lz4/blobs/sha256:2bad368b2869db32b1b22cea76a6e65da2f4e599ac8ee327b4825d54c4579445
```

Then, you can download the bottles by running the curl command generated by the tool. (The current version only supports indirect downloading through `curl`, and I am still figuring out how to implement equivalent operations in Swift). If you wish to download bottles compiled for Apple Silicon, simply prepend `arm64_` before the version number.

## How to actually run the downloaded binary?

Adjust the `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable or use `install_name_tool`.

## How to build?

```shell
swift build -c release
```

Or in `Xcode -> Product -> Archive`.

You can also use it similar to a shell script: `swift Sources/main.swift xz sonoma`.
